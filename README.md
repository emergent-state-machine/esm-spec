**Emergent State Machine: A Turn-Based Control Architecture — v1.0.0**

This release updates the architecture paper to align with the ESM specification v1.0.0.

Major clarifications include:

- explicit separation of **Signal**, **Projection**, and **Authority** layers
- introduction of **primitive detectors** and **signals** as the measurement interface
- formalization of **control state** within the policy decision boundary
- clarification of the **authority boundary** separating interpretation from action
- expanded definition of **Instrumented Deterministic Evolution (IDE)**

The paper now reflects the current architectural model used in the ESM specification.

## Emergent State Machine (ESM)

The **Emergent State Machine (ESM)** is a turn-based control architecture for governing state mutation in model-assisted systems.

ESM makes the decision boundary explicit by separating:

- **Signals** - measurement
- **Interpretation** - evaluation
- **Authorization** - authority to mutate state

Each interaction is bound into a **Turn**, which records the versions of signal logic, interpretation logic, and authorization policy in effect at that moment. State may only evolve through this structured boundary.

The result is a system where evolution is:

- Reconstructible
- Versioned
- Inspectable
- Governable

ESM is domain-agnostic. It applies wherever probabilistic interpretation and consequential state mutation must coexist — including AI-assisted systems, digital twins, enterprise workflows, and learning platforms.

For systems that require a deterministic and instrumented mutation boundary, the ESM architecture can be implemented using a **[Controlled Mutation Layer (CML)](https://github.com/controlled-mutation-layer)**.

> > > > > > > c8b92b4 (Add DLC design narrative preprint v0.9.0)
> > > > > > > Each **Turn** records the versions of:

- signal detectors
- projection logic
- policy rules

This makes every state transition **replayable, inspectable, and governable**.

## Why This Exists

Modern AI systems frequently entangle:

- Interpretation
- Decision authority
- Generative output

This entanglement makes systems difficult to:

- Audit
- Reproduce
- Version safely
- Govern at scale

ESM addresses this by enforcing a strict architectural separation between descriptive projection and authoritative mutation.

Behavioral change may occur only through explicit, versioned state transitions at the authoritative mutation boundary — never through implicit drift.

In many implementations, this boundary is enforced through a Controlled Mutation Layer (CML).

## Scope of This Repository

This repository contains the **normative specification** of the ESM pattern:

- Formal execution model
- Required invariants
- Clarification and ambiguity handling rules
- Versioning guarantees
- Instrumented Deterministic Evolution (IDE)

It does not contain application code.

## Release History

### v1.0.0 — First Public Release

First public release of the Emergent State Machine (ESM) architectural specification.

This release clarifies:

- the separation of Signal, Projection, and Authority layers
- primitive detectors, signals, and feature vectors
- deterministic policy as the exclusive mutation authority
- the placement of probabilistic interpretation within the Projection Layer
- hierarchical composition of nested ESMs
- norm ladders as staged operational or learning progressions

See:

- [`spec/esm_spec.md`](spec/esm_spec.md)
- [GitHub Release: v1.0.0](../../releases/tag/v1.0.0)

### v0.9.1 — Late Pre-Release Draft

Late pre-release draft of the Emergent State Machine architectural specification.

This version is retained as a historical reference point immediately prior to the first stable public release.

Contents at this tag included:

- draft specification at `spec/esm_spec.md`
- accompanying draft paper and LaTeX sources

### Designing the Digital Learning Companion

_A Narrative of Discovery and the Emergence of the Emergent State Machine_

This paper presents a design narrative describing how the Emergent State Machine (ESM) architecture was discovered during the development of an AI-assisted tutoring system called the **Digital Learning Companion (DLC)**.

Through iterative experimentation with a conversational AI partner, the project gradually revealed a structural pattern governing how learner interactions could be evaluated and how system state could evolve through discrete, observable turns.
